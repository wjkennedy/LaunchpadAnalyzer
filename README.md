What does Critical Infrastructure look like? What do you think it looks like?

Here is an example: Canonical Launchpad

It’s where Ubuntu engineering happens, and it’s a Canonical invention…

Rather than use GitHub and Jira, as so many software products might, Canonical Engineers (and Users) also make the software to make “The Software” (https://lnkd.in/dW2qezNE)

Ubuntu is so prevalent, Microsoft have recently stopped reporting on their own Server software sales because Ubuntu is such a proportionately larger piece of Azures cloud compute offering (and sales).

Your favorite SaaS uses it — by default (!)

Your favorite websites depend on what Launchpad offers in terms of Developer Experience. Could it be better?
